# Feed Tillers

A simple Data Broker (LDB) plugin that lists the Tiller, what food they want for the quests **A Dish for ...** and if you have completed that quest today.

## You need a LibDataBroker "Broker" display.

Some examples include ChocolateBar, NinjaPanel, Fortress, StatCore. While Titan Panel supports Broker plugins, it is not a native Broker display, and comes pre-loaded with its own Titan plugins. The advantage of Broker displays (aside from Titan Panel) is that you can change display addons without impacting plugins or plugin settings.

## Optional support for TomTom

If you have [TomTom](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tomtom) installed, you can create a waypoint arrow to individual Tillers. The arrow may not display until you are on the continent of Pandaria. Some Tillers are not in Halfhill, and are instead at their homes.

## Translating into other languages

There are are a few words and phrases which need translating, and they can be found in the [localization app](https://www.wowace.com/projects/feedtillers/localization). You can use your Curseforge/Twitch login if required.
